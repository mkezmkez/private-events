<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Rails allows us to build complex apps with databases using merely a few lines of code. By understanding Active records, we can easly create and manipulate data and even store it in the database without actually writing any SQL commands.

----
The goal of this project is to apply multiple associations between the tables of our schema.
